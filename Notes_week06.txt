Rationale for the usage of genetic algorithms -
1. Our problem is a dichotonomous problem.
2. The data is small enough to be trained with 10 seconds or less.
3. The selection of features in both the proteins and the ligands must be complementory.
4. There are 2 possible solutions to this -
        a. Combinatorial optimization.
        b. Genetics Algorithm optimization.


--->
Started writing report.
Did not use polynomial regression - too many parameters to handle.
The score is better than the correlation calculator - with the problem that there are a lot of features (200+)
    However, we are getting good results with half of the features.


Suggestion -
    Genetic Algo - Start with 25 % selection of features --> before applying penalty.
    Balance between protein and ligand features.....
        2 crossovers maybe good for the balancing.

Find out the CPU resource it takes ...
   CPU days/hours ...

Benchmarking or comparisons ...
   extracting features from the sequences ...
