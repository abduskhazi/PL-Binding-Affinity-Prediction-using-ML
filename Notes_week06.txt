Exam registration - 
Pruefungsleistung registration ==> Success.
Studienleistung registration ==> Not a Success.


Rationale for the usage of genetic algorithms -
1. Our problem is a dichotonomous problem.
2. The data is small enough to be trained with 10 seconds or less.
3. The selection of features in both the proteins and the ligands must be complementory.
4. There are 2 possible solutions to this -
        a. Combinatorial optimization.
        b. Genetics Algorithm optimization.
