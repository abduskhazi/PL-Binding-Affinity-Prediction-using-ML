Things done this week -
1. Read the paper and integrated the code.
    --> Show the ticket and the code
    --> Explain what I understood in the paper.
2. Revisited the depricated models (Because the models were built using specific features and not all)
    --> Show the SVR statistics
    --> Show how NN gets stuck in a local minima. (Not very good local minima)
3. Fixed the genetic algorithm bug. (Check issues)
    --> Show the statistics obtained using normal score
    --> Show the statistics obtained using the 2D score.

NEXT THINGS -
1. Forgot to implement elitism (Will do this week)
2. With boostrap PCA calculation in rotation forest ...***
3. Maybe scoring function = (initial_score - current_score)*num_features^2
4. When data avaialble ... Try narine's protein featurization.
