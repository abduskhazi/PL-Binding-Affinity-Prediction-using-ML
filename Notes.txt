Representation of molecules

SMILES - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system
1. It is used to represent molecules as an ASCII string.
2. The molecules are first given input as a graph where nodes are atoms and bonds are undirected edjes.
3. All hydrogen atoms are trimmed (They are assumed to exist when the # bonds < required for an element)
4. A spanning tree is created by removing all the cycles.
5. A depth first traversel of the graphs is done to form the SMILES string.

    Advantage:
        1. Easier/standadized representation of the molecules
    Disadvantage:
        1. Non unique representation of the molecule. Infact the number of representations are exponential.
        2. 3-D structure differentiation representation requires special characters. (For physical isomorphs)
        3. More than one unique representations possible for a molecule.

XYZ format - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6K8k0sH2TY 
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format
1. This is used to represent the molecule in its 3D shape.
2. All the atoms are represented with X, Y and Z coordinates hence the name XYZ format.
3. The X,Y,Z coordinates given are relative to each other hence, translation and rotation do not change the represenation.

    Advantage:
    1. 3D structure is inbuilt in the representation
    Disadvantage:
    2. Connectivity information is calculated and is not implicit.

PDB format - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1q7sfjl2Kw
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)
1. Used to represent the protein molecules (macro molecules)
2. Contains information regarding the coordinates of atoms like the XYZ format. (Armstrong units)
3. Contains information regarding protein secondary structures.
4. Molecular visualization is possible using specialized software. 
5. Column specific (Due to legacy conditions)

SDF Format - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file
1. It is a type of molecular descriptive file.
2. Contains information similar to xyz format.
3. In addition to this contains bond information.
4. [My observation] Can be used to create a graph using which SMILES string can be created.
