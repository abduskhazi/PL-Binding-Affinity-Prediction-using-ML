First convert all files to smi files.

Could only sythesyse 7000 out of ~11000 ligands to smiles.

find . | grep sdf | xargs -n 1 python ../Repository/galaxytools/chemicaltoolbox/rdkit/rdkit_descriptors.py --iformat sdf -i > ligand_descriptors.dat

Getting errors is this cause for concern? - 
ERROR: Explicit valence for atom # 2 C, 6, is greater than permitted
[12:15:31] Explicit valence for atom # 0 C, 6, is greater than permitted
[12:15:31] ERROR: Could not sanitize molecule ending on line 301


When using mol2 format - we get the following warning = (O.co2 with non C.2 or S.o2 neighbor.)
    also getting the following error ==> Warning - O.co2 with degree >1.
    Can't kekulize mol.  Unkekulized atoms: 9 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 18
    no explicit hydrogens in mol2 file but needed for formal charge estimation. TODO (may be related to explicit valence)----> Assumed in file formats. Find functionality to add missing hydrogen atoms.

TODO -------> Perform sanitization process. (script)
     -------> 2019... vs 2015. maybe get the latest version.
     -------> Add hydrogen atoms.
     ----> Download again pdbdataset for getting ID of the ligand.

(Done)
Unable to do libXrender.so so I did on my compute to save time.


Got more descriptors in mol2 format.



find . | grep _protein.pdb | xargs -n 1 fpocket -f ==> for running fpocket on al the proteins.
Errors obtained -
exceeding memory size for each grid element***** POCKET HUNTING ENDS *****


Questions - 
What is resname for getting the binding descriptions (of proteins using dpocket)
