Reproducability -
    For reproduciblity I print the random seed on the first line.
    If we use this seed. We can reproduce the result exactly.

Observation -
    Random Forest regresser is giving a very high accuracy of R^2 score > 0.75
    Out of bag score is also 0.75 consistently.
    The oob score ~= R^2 score on the validation set if we use ~200 tries in our emsemble.
    Why is this model predicting things so accurately - Still researching.

How to know if the protein/ligand features are being taken into account?
    Random shuffle the protein features and check the result.
    Random shuffle the ligand features and check the result.

Observation
    Ligand features have a huge impact on the regressor.

For feature importance calculation -
    Using permutation feature importance calculation.
    THe issue with this is correlation between features. (There needs to be a clustering of features that are correlated.)
