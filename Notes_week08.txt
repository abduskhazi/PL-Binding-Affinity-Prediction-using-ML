Reproducability -
    For reproduciblity I print the random seed on the first line.
    If we re-use this seed. We can reproduce the result exactly.

Observation -
    Random Forest regresser is giving a very high accuracy of R^2 score > 0.75
    Out of bag score is also 0.75 consistently.
    The oob score ~= R^2 score on the validation set if we use ~200 trees in our emsemble.
    When we use exp data --> This is signifantly bad ~ 0.55. Still do not know why
    Why is this model predicting things so accurately - Still researching.

How to know if the protein/ligand features are being taken into account?
    Fit the model using all the feature
    Random shuffle the protein features of the X_validate variable and check the prediction.
    Do the same thing to check the usage of ligand features.

Observation
    Ligand features have a huge impact on the regressor.

For feature importance calculation -
    1. Using entropy reduction calculation (By default given by our regressor model)
    2. Using permutation feature importance calculation.
       The issue with this is correlation between features. (There needs to be a clustering of features that are correlated.)
