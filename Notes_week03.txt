******************* COMPLETED ************************
1. I downloaded 2019 PDBbind dataset.
2. Added hydrogen to all ligand files of sdf format. Adding hydrogen to mol2 makes the descriptor generation fail.
3. Installed standardise from conda. We have 2 options -
    a. Standardiser (does not run)
    b. Standardise-mols (does not solve the problem).

For the LIGANDS finally did the following
1. Ran mol2 --> got the results ~15700
2. Ran sdf on the non existent ligands. ~1300
3. Combined above results and eliminated duplicates (if any) --> mixed data set ~17000 / 17600 obtained.

PDBbind databank had the problem that Ligands were not present in the pdb files. So,
1. Downloaded and extracted the required pdbs files - from protein data bank directly
2. used dpocket to generate the binding pocket descriptors -> 55 features.
3. dpocket generates 3 output files -
    a. dpout_fpocketp.txt --> Lists all the possible pocket (with descriptors) that could bind to ligand according to a criteria.
                              Multiple pockets for the same ligand and same protein possible.
                              overlap <= 100%.
    b. dpout_fpocketnp.txt --> Lists all pockets (with descriptors) that are not binding according to the criteria.
    c. dpout_explicitp.txt --> Lists all the explicitly binding pocket (with descriptors)
                               overlap = 100% always.
4. Some entries list 5-mer and wrong entries were not processed.
    a. But there are atoms HET in the pdb files. Do we need to extract them? They seem to have correct ATOMS.


******************* DISCUSSION ************************
1. protein features + mixed_ligand_descriptors ==> Our data set.
2. Kd=10mM or ki found in the index files is our target regression variable.
3. For feature selection
    a. Explanability of the selected dimensions is more important. Using PCA may remove the explanability of our data.
    b. ===> check page 9 report of narine for getting idea about the feature selection.
4. There are a few nan values. Perhaps exclude the nan values .. (exclude the whole row exclusion or exclude the column). Do this for both protein and ligand
5. Dimentionality reduction / feature selection - Try to reduce dimentions of ligands because the number of descriptors for ligands >> protiens.
    a. PCA or find corrrelations... read more about dimentionality reduce techniques.
[UPDATE] - explicitp have ~15000 pocket descriptors. fpocketp have ~35000 data points.


******************* NEXT STEPS ************************
1. Read the papers that I have not read. (Done)
2. Check if the descriptors calculated from mol2 and sdf are the same. (To make sure that mixing them is ok) (Done: ligand/difference_report) --> Use just mol2 for now....
3. For hydrogen addition = Remove H in a sample sdf file and see if the script adds them. (If we remove H row from the sdf file ==> The molecule is no longer valid) ---> (Keep this for documentation for later)
4. Send the ligands complex names to Simon for further understanding their problem (~600) (Done)
5. Which column in dpocket descriptors contains the nan. --> inform simon. (Check nan_report_dpocket and ligand/nan_report) push the removal after all the feature selections. Maybe removing the as_density.
6. Create the distinct data sets for the core/general complexes according to the pdbbind data set. (Done but dont think helpful)


Still clarification is required about explicitp and fpocketp files generated by dpocket.
