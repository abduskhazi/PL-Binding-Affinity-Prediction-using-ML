Things completed -
1. Finished writing the report (Show report if asked)
2. Tried out manual feature selection and reported results.
3. Finished exclusion of families and fitting the models.
4. Genetic algorithm.
   --> Computationally feasible if we shuffle the columns.
   --> Yet to run for a long run.



Issues I faced -
1. Even when I excluded families of features, my models are still reporting good results.
2. Saw that there is difference between validation and training set.
    If I try to reduce it by regularising the validation error goes down as well.
===> Any advices on this? (Check hyperperparameters...)


Elitism .... Dont forget to test this part for random forest geen.... 

Next steps -
1.
2.
3.
4.

Comments and feedback -
Report - Given by Simon

Hyperparameters
Dont limit the number of nodes ....

Check this ---> ****
Rotation forest .... (Read about this)
    Modified version of random forest....
    May outperform random forest.... ? 2020 April paper..
    (Check if it is well implemented and integrate for our data)

Different models first .... then autoML.

ANT optimization --> Different from rotation forest.



Next Steps .....
1. Complete and report the genetic run form randome forest..
2. Rotation forests read paper and use implementation..
3. Use narine's method for featuring for featurizing protein.
   *** Data is already created for PDB bind. + RD
4. Other featuring methods for ligand --> Yet to do..
