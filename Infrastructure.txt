Here we describe the infrastructure of our project including description of our data.

PCBA dataset - 
1. It is a csv file in which each line of our file represents a molecule
2. The 2nd last columns represent a module ID (CID*) which is an ID given by PubChem website.
3. Last column represents the SMILE string of our molecule.
4. All other columns are PCBA<num> (PubChem BioAssay). The represents an assessment of the molecule w.r.t to a biological experiment* (More information needed). Their values are {empty, 0, 1} for each record.
